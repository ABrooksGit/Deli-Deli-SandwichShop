# DELI-DELI-SANDWICH SHOP
YearUp Capstone 2:


This is DELI-DELI-SANDWICH SHOP, when you run this program
it will prompt the user to input if they want to create an order or not. 
If they choose to do so, they will be asked to input their name which will then
be saved along with the creation of their "order". The name is stored so when they 
receive a receipt they can see the name they inputted. 

This is set up in a way that if a user chooses to create a sandwich it will prompt the user to
input each part of making that sandwich. After filling out every prompt shown, the sandwich is then added
to the "order". 

The process to creating a signature sandwich or a sandwich from a menu is similar, but instead of having the sandwich
start out blank, the sandwich starts out with ingredients already there and the user can then choose if they want to 
keep those ingredients as is, or swap them out for a new one, while also being able to add another of their choice.
Once this process in done, the sandwich is saved to the same "order". 

Moving on to Drinks, For drinks, all the user has to do is choose from a list of flavors that is provided and then the 
size of the drink that they want. With the sandwiches there wasn't a need to type out anything, it was all provided on
screen with a number next to it. This part is the same with drinks, however, once you choose that drink, the user will
then be prompted to input the size of the drink. This will have to be typed out as these choices: Small, Medium, Large.
Once this is completed, this too will be saved to the same "order".

Lastly we have Chips, Unlike drinks and sandwiches chips do not have a size to input, when it comes to chips all the
user has to input is the number related to the kind of bag of chips that they want and then that bag of chips will be
added to the same "order".

Now that we have an order, we have two options we can go to the checkout screen and see the total price of everything. 
If you are unsatisfied with the order and want to add more, you can back out from here and continue adding to the order. 
Once you have everything settled you can go ahead and get the receipt. The second option is to undo everything by cancelling
the entire order. The user will then be booted back out where they have to reenter their name, which creates a new order.

The receipt will start with the name of the sandwich shop then provide a list of all the items you have ordered along with 
their price. Once that is done the price is added together for the total. Then the receipt shows who ordered the items.
Another space down we get a thank-you message. Then one more space down we get the time the order was completed.
